tags: [typescript, style]

Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones. Do not add comments explaining what code does; only comment on non-obvious why. Avoid premature abstraction — three similar lines beat a speculative helper. Use strict TypeScript; no implicit any.`,

  "git-safety.md": `---
tags: [git, safety]
---
Never force-push to main. Never run \`git reset --hard\` without checking \`git status\` first for uncommitted work. Always create new commits rather than amending published ones. Never skip commit hooks with \`--no-verify\` unless explicitly asked.`,

  "testing.md": `---
tags: [testing]
---
Write tests for new functionality. Prefer integration tests over mocks when database/external state matters. Name tests clearly: what is being tested and what the expected outcome is.`,

  "security.md": `---
tags: [security]
---
Sanitize all user input. Never construct SQL queries with string concatenation — use parameterized queries. Avoid exposing internal errors to users; log them server-side and return generic error messages. Check authorization at every handler.`,

  "react-ui.md": `---
tags: [react, ui]
---
Keep components focused on one responsibility. Extract hooks for complex stateful logic. Prefer composition over deeply nested conditional rendering. Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility.`,

  "commits.md": `---
tags: [git, commits]
---
Write commit messages that explain why, not what. Use conventional commit format: \`feat:\`, \`fix:\`, \`refactor:\`, \`docs:\`, \`test:\`. Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit. Always review \`git diff --staged\` before committing.`,

export const README = `# ClaudeZero

This repository is configured with **claude0** — a deterministic orchestration spine for Claude Code.

## What It Does

- **Context compilation**: Every prompt gets only the relevant rules, not the full CLAUDE.md
- **Tool-output compression**: Verbose command output is shrunk before it reaches the model, and stashed so you can \`claude0 recall\` the original
- **Honest accounting**: Every operation logs real token counts to \`.claude0/ledger.jsonl\`; run \`claude0 report\` to see your actual savings
- **Routing**: Picks the cheapest Anthropic tier (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) that can pass each step

## Daily Usage

After initialization, claude0 is **transparent** — just use Claude Code normally:

\`\`\`bash
claude> fix the auth bug
# ClaudeZero automatically:
# - Compiles minimal context (only security, typescript, testing rules)
# - Routes to appropriate tier (likely Sonnet for implementation)
# - Logs tokens_in, baseline_tokens, savings to ledger
\`\`\`

## Explicit Orchestration

For complex features, use the full design → plan → build → verify loop:

\`\`\`bash
claude> /claude0 build "add user authentication"
# Runs: DESIGN (debate) → PLAN (milestones) → GATE → BUILD → VERIFY
\`\`\`

## Reporting

Check token savings and system behavior:

\`\`\`bash
claude0 report
# Shows: total runs, savings %, tier mix, escalation rate, stuck count
\`\`\`

## Files

- \`.claude0/rules/*.md\` — Context rules, one concern per file, frontmatter-tagged
- \`.claude0/policy.yaml\` — Step-to-tier routing policy (auto-tuned over time)
- \`.claude0/ledger.jsonl\` — Append-only log of every operation
- \`.claude/settings.json\` — Hook configuration (added by \`claude0 init\`)
